## Setup the development environment

### You will need

* [Git][git]
* [Docker CE][docker-ce] and [Docker Compose][docker-compose]  
  Follow the [instructions on the docker website][docker-install] to install these.

### Clone the Git repo

    git clone git@github.com:openstax/rap-concourse-spike.git

This will download the code into a `rap-concourse-spike` directory. You will need to be in  the `rap-concourse-spike` directory for the remainder of the installation process.

    cd rap-concourse-spike

### Run the services with Docker Compose

Start the services that are required with Docker Compose:

    make services

You'll now have four Docker containers running the PostgreSQL databases for cnx-db and Concourse, the Concourse application, and RabbitMQ. You should be able to see all the services by running:

    docker-compose ps

To stop any of the docker containers, obtain the CONTAINER ID by running `docker container ls`, then:

    docker stop [CONTAINER ID]

### Initialize DB on first run

On first run the DB needs to be recreated from the DB dump:

    make initdb

This reinitializes the DB (drops, recreates DB and restores DB dump) with this three books:

Elementary Algebra (col12116), id `0889907c-f0ef-496a-bcb8-2a5bb121717f`
Intermediate Algebra (col12119), id `02776133-d49d-49cb-bfaa-67c7f61b25a1`
Prealgebra (col11756), id `caa57dab-41c7-455e-bd6f-f443cda5519c`
