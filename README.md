# rap-concourse-spike
Exploring Concourse-CIâ€™s (Continuous Integration) queue resource for use in the final product of Refactor Archive.

## Creating the concourse spike development environment

### You will need

* [Git][git]
* [Docker CE][docker-ce] and [Docker Compose][docker-compose]  
  Follow the [instructions on the docker website][docker-install] to install these.

### Clone the Git repo

    git clone git@github.com:openstax/rap-concourse-spike.git

This will download the code into a `rap-concourse-spike` directory. You will need to be in  the `rap-concourse-spike` directory for the remainder of the installation process.

    cd rap-concourse-spike

### Run the services with Docker Compose

Start the services that are required with Docker Compose:

    make services

You'll now have four Docker containers running the PostgreSQL databases for cnx-db and Concourse, the Concourse application, and RabbitMQ. You should be able to see all the services by running:

    docker-compose ps

To stop any of the docker containers, obtain the CONTAINER ID by running `docker container ls`, then:

    docker stop [CONTAINER ID]
