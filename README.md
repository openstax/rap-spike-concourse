## Setup the development environment

### You will need

* [Git][git]
* [Docker CE][docker-ce] and [Docker Compose][docker-compose]  
  Follow the [instructions on the docker website][docker-install] to install these.

### Clone the Git repo

    git clone git@github.com:openstax/rap-spike-concourse.git

This will download the code into a `rap-spike-concourse` directory. You will need to be in  the `rap-spike-concourse` directory for the remainder of the installation process.

    cd rap-spike-concourse

### Run the services with Docker Compose

Start the services that are required with Docker Compose:

    make services

You'll now have four Docker containers running the PostgreSQL databases for cnx-db and Concourse, the Concourse application, and RabbitMQ. You should be able to see all the services by running:

    docker-compose ps

To stop any of the docker containers:

    docker-compose stop [SERVICE...]  # e.g. docker-compose stop cnx-db

### Initialize DB on first run

On first run the DB needs to be recreated from the DB dump:

    make initdb

This reinitializes the DB (drops, recreates DB and restores DB dump) with this three books:

* Elementary Algebra (col12116), id `0889907c-f0ef-496a-bcb8-2a5bb121717f`
* Intermediate Algebra (col12119), id `02776133-d49d-49cb-bfaa-67c7f61b25a1`
* Prealgebra (col11756), id `caa57dab-41c7-455e-bd6f-f443cda5519c`

## Access Services

Access the services that have been started by Docker Compose.

- Concourse-CI (HTTP): http://localhost:8080
- RabbitMQ (AMQP): amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672
- RabbitMQ Management (HTTP): http://guest:guest@localhost:15672
- Postgres: postgres://rhaptos@localhost:15432/repository

### RabbitMQ

Log into RabbitMQ with your browser, visit `http://localhost:15672`

Enter the following to login

```
username: guest
password: guest
```

### Concourse

Log into Concourse with your browser, visit `http://localhost:8080`

Enter the following to login

```
username: test
password: test
```

#### Content Event API via FLASK

1. See events:
```
curl localhost:5000/events
```

2. Add event:
```
$ curl -d '{"ident_hash": "0889907c-f0ef-496a-bcb8-2a5bb121717f"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5000/events
```

3. See event:
```
$ curl localhost:5000/events/<id>
```

#### Postgres
Log in with psql shell to cnx-db

    make sql

### S3 access for debugging

You need opensource software [rclone][rclone] for this guide. rclone enables accessing various cloud storage providers in a way similar to rsync. It also let's you mount s3 with FUSE.

Please install it using [this guide][rcloneinstall].

Info for Mac users:

* Install [FUSE for macOS][macosfuse] first.
* You can install rclone easily with `brew install rclone`.

#### Get your S3 credentials

Login to your [aws console][awsconsole] with your credentials.

Go to upper right corner to "My Security Credentials"

![securitycredentials](https://i.imgur.com/ltnzm71.png)

Now create access keys

![accesskeys](https://i.imgur.com/zXe2dlA.png)

Copy&Paste this access keys (key id & secret access key) into your password manager or download them. You will need them later.

#### Setting up rclone

We will create a new remote location named `openstax` for accessing the Openstax sandbox buckets. If not already done [install rclone][rcloneinstall] (e.g. on Mac with `brew install rclone`).

* Configure rclone with and create a new remote (n):

```
rclone config
```

![rcloneconfig](https://i.imgur.com/jdUiGMP.png)

* Name it e.g. `openstax` and choose Amazon S3:

![rclones3](https://i.imgur.com/DGGVWAw.png)

* Choose S3
* Enter AWS credentials in next step
* Now enter your access key id and secret access key inside:

![rclonesecret](https://i.imgur.com/24yuike.png)

* Choose Ohio: `us-east-2`
* Use default entpoint
* Choose again Ohio: `us-east-2`
* Choose FULL_CONTROL for owner (default):

![rclonefullcontrol](https://i.imgur.com/hp7zL2k.png)

* Choose no server side encryption
* No KMS ID:

![rclonekms](https://i.imgur.com/pquRRqW.png)

* Default storage class
* No advanced config

* At the end confirm all your settings which should look similar to this:

![rcloneconfirm](https://i.imgur.com/O128Y4l.png)

* quit config

#### Test that rclone works

Run following command to remote `openstax` look at the buckets available:

```
rclone lsd openstax:
```

You should see a list of buckets and also our test bucket `ce-rap-test`:

![ce-rap-test](https://i.imgur.com/9AALpsA.png)

#### How to use rclone

Some examples of rclone usage.

List the contents of bucket `ce-rap-test`:

```
rclone ls openstax:ce-rap-test
```

Copy all content from `ce-rap-test` to your current directory:

```
rclone copy openstax:ce-rap-test ./
```

Copy one file into the bucket:

```
rclone copy ./nothinginside.md openstax:ce-rap-test/
```

Information: Be careful with `move` and `delete` commands!

#### How to mount a bucket into your local filesystem with FUSE

rclone can also mount buckets into your local filesystem with FUSE.

Info: On mac you need to install [FUSE for macOS][macosfuse] first.

First create a local folder e.g. in your home dir where you want to mount the bucket. For example:

```
mkdir ~/s3files
```

Now mount the bucket with rclone:

```
rclone mount openstax:ce-rap-test ~/s3files
```

**Now you can use that folder as remote mount and can copy/move/delete files into s3 and out!**

To stop mounting press `Ctrl-C`. Sometimes unmounting can fail. In this case use this command to unmount your mount folder manually:

```bash
# Linux
fusermount -u /s3files
# OS X
umount /s3files
```

#### Mac and Cyberduck

On macOS there is a very easy to use UI interface for accessing S3 buckets and also for managing user rights in S3 buckets.

It's free and easy to use: [CyberDuck][cyberduck]

I don't write a specific guide for Cyberduck because it is self explanatory and works quite similar to FTP programs.
